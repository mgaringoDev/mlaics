## What is face recognition

- `liveness detection`

###  Face Verification vs Face Recognition

__Verification__
- input image, name/ID (1:1)
- output whether the input image is that of the claimed person

__Recognition__
- has a database of K people (1:K)
- get an input image
- output ID if the image is any of the K people (or `not recognized`)
- We can use a face verification system to make a face recognition system. The accuracy of the verification system has to be high (around 99.9% or more) to be use accurately within a recognition system because the recognition system accuracy will be less than the verification system given K persons. 
	- you basically need to solve a `one-shot-learning` problem


## One Shot Learning
- recognize a person with just one single image or given just one example of that person's face
	- traditionally NN don't work well when you only have one sample
		- you may only have one picture of that employee
	- this section will try and solve this problem

- `naive` approach
	- create a CNN with input images of the people
	- using softmax output labels of each person plus not-recognize
	- what happens if a new person comes in .... do you have to retrain the system ... this is not a good approach

- `similarity` function approach
	- d(img1, img2) =  degree of difference between images
		- if d()<= tau # `same` tau is a hyper parameter
		- if d() > tau # `different`

- make the CNN learn this similarity function such it helps us solving the one shot learning. Also its robust to new inputs.

## Siamese Network

- We will implement the similarity function using a type of NNs called Siamease Network in which we can pass multiple inputs to the two or more networks with the same architecture and parameters.

- Siamese network architecture are as the following:
  - ![](Images/35.png)
  - We make 2 identical conv nets which encodes an input image into a vector. In the above image the vector shape is (128, )
  - The loss function will be `d(x1, x2) = || f(x1) - f(x2) ||^2`
  - If `X1`, `X2` are the same person, we want d to be low. If they are different persons, we want d to be high.

- > So what you want to do is really train the neural network so that the encoding that it computes results in a function d that tells you when two pictures are of the same person.

- parameters of the convNet define an encoding of the image to a 128 vector
$$ f(x^i)$$

- therefore you want to learn parameters so that:
	- if $$x^i$$ $$x^j$$ are the __same__ person then the loss function should be __small__
	- if $$x^i$$ $$x^j$$ are the __different__ person then the loss function should be __large__

	- > And what you can do is use back propagation and vary all those parameters in order to make sure these conditions are satisfied., marked from 4 minutes 20 seconds till 4 minutes 29 secondsAnd what you can do is use back propagation and vary all those parameters in order to make sure these conditions are satisfied.
