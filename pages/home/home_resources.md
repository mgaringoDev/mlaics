### Graphing
- **[Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/)** is a JavaScript visualization library with a Python frontend that creates highly interactive visualizations capable of handling very large and/or streaming datasets. The Python front-end outputs a JSON data structure that can be interpreted by the Bokeh JS engine.
- **[Plotly](https://plotly.com/)** is the eponymous open source product of the Plotly company, and is similar in spirit to Bokeh. Because Plotly is the main product of a startup, it is receiving a high level of development effort. Use of the library is entirely free.
- **[Vispy](http://vispy.org/)** is an actively developed project focused on dynamic visualizations of very large datasets. Because it is built to target OpenGL and make use of efficient graphics processors in your computer, it is able to render some quite large and stunning visualizations.
- **[Vega](https://vega.github.io/)** and **[Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)** are declarative graphics representations, and are the product of years of research into the fundamental language of data visualization. The reference rendering implementation is JavaScript, but the API is language agnostic. There is a Python API under development in the **[Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)** package. Though as of summer 2016 it's not yet fully mature, I'm quite excited for the possibilities of this project to provide a common reference point for visualization in Python and other languages.
