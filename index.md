# What is machine learning?

One definition: **"Machine learning is the semi-automated extraction of knowledge from data"**

- **Knowledge from data**: Starts with a question that might be answerable using data
- **Automated extraction**: A computer provides the insight
- **Semi-automated**: Requires many smart decisions by a human

This contains only my notes on ML and not any implementation.  I decided to make this very clean for note taking only and easy organization.  This may change overtime but currently this is what I have decided.
