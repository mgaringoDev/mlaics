  bio: My expertise lie in the analysis of various biological, acoustic and image signals. Though very knowledgeable in machine learning techniques my skill set is primarily honed in extracting meaningful information from various time series signals. My philosophy is understanding the underlying cause of the problem rather than creating a block box approach to solving it.

  bio: David is a PhD student in the School of Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. David earned a Master’s degree in experimental condensed matter physics at Brigham Young University where he fabricated and characterized thin-films and carbon nanotubes used in nanostructured high capacity battery electrodes and in X-ray windows. As an undergraduate, David studied theoretical physics and researched the evolution of chaotic systems using neural networks at Westminster College. He is a trainee in the NSF IGERT FLAMEL program, and one of the lead developers on PyMKS materials informatics toolkit.
